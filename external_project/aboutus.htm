            <h2>Here is more about Deja Brew!</h2>
            <p> Deja Brew was founded on a simple yet profound love for coffee and community. It all began when 
                our founders, lifelong friends and coffee enthusiasts, embarked on a journey to create a unique 
                space where people could come together to enjoy exceptional coffee and meaningful connections. 
                Inspired by their travels and the diverse coffee cultures they encountered, they envisioned a 
                place that blends the warmth of a neighborhood café with the sophistication of artisanal coffee 
                craftsmanship. After months of meticulous planning, sourcing the finest beans, and perfecting 
                their brews, Deja Brew opened its doors, quickly becoming a beloved local spot where every cup 
                tells a story and every visit feels like coming home.
